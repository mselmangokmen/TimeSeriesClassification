# TimeSeries Classification and Forecasting
This repository is created for experiments on time series classification and forecasting.   
For now, the model has been modified for classification task. In coming days, the model will be modified for forecasting.  

Modifications made on the traditional Transformer model used for NLP. 


Traditional transformer models get a sequence as input and I take the advantage of this sequence input.


You can find hyper parameters in model_summary.py file. 
The output for model summary is represented below.
